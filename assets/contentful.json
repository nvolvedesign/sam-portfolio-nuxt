When they reached out to my business partner AJ (developer) and I, their website was in need of a complete overhaul. This is how we approached it.","body":"## UNDERSTANDING THE CLIENT’S NEEDS\nInitially, their site only supported a desktop experience and their payment process was a bit unclear. It lacked effective indicators to lead a users to a successful step by step process.\n\n![nap-old-site](//images.ctfassets.net/lb2zj3x6udwv/2ljwc4XvG0wogWgW0UKKEo/4ee356a8dafc54665901d6132d203259/nap-old-site.png)\n\n## GET WIRED\nI wire-framed the homepage to prioritize primary users and functionality. The primary users of this website were patients and primary functionality included processing a payment directly to NAP. Other functionality would include an updatable staff/job listings page and the ability for a user to fill out a contact form on each page.\n\n![nap-users-functionality](//images.ctfassets.net/lb2zj3x6udwv/26by46hksYqqMYMou4eqOC/661df7373f0f51f0bfe7bc0e0f4b3105/nap-users-functionality.png)\n\n## 50 SHADES OF #808080\nAfter whiteboarding a simple layout, I quickly designed a grayscale low-fidelity prototype for mobile and desktop. I then uploaded it to invision for the NAP stakeholders to review.\n\n![nap-low-fidelity](//images.ctfassets.net/lb2zj3x6udwv/2wB2fL3eyUa2OEwauUeyqA/92bed0cce601259681d2ab814237e10a/nap-low-fidelity.png)\n\n## ON THE GRID\nOnce the low-fidelity prototype was approved, it was important to ask AJ (developer) a few questions before moving forward. Potential design systems and grid layouts and other front-end questions needed to be addressed before I moved any pixels. Because this was our first project together, it was important to understand the use of a few frameworks in order to consider implementing certain design elements.\n\n### LOCKING IT IN\nThe following was implemented to initiate the design and development process for this project.\n\n- Material Design – Google’s UI Design System\n- 8-Point Grid System – A scalable integral method for building components utilizing 8px\n- Bitters – styling library\n- Swiper – for the payment form slider\n- Cleave – for automatically formatting the credit card and phone number inputs on the payment form\n- ParsleyJS – for client-side input validation\n\nNAP’s old website was using a payment system called JetPay, which had to be carried over to this project. It was important to find early design limitation (if any) to JetPay in order to design around their payment API.\n\n## THE GOAL: SIMPLICITY\nI then designed a high-fidelity prototype that mirrored an identical experience to what we envisioned the finalized website to be. Because the goal was to create a seamless experience, I included a status bar above the next button to represent the pagination that would indicate a user’s progress within a 3 step payment process. I also ensured that the process would contain visuals and messaging for user success/error. This solidified all front-end development needs.\n\n![nap-iphone-nav-v1](//images.ctfassets.net/lb2zj3x6udwv/4WCJTbDhG0k4CQcAC6SkES/28d8f370042cd315f1a99f3e47813b22/nap-iphone-nav-v1.png)\n\n## THE NEW NAP-PC.COM\nAfter enabling an emulation of the actual website for our client to test, they were pleased to know that their website worked as intended. After receiving their final green light, we successfully pushed the site live.\n\nBelow are the finalized prototypes for both mobile and desktop.
