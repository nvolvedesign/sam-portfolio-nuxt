            I am Sam, a UX Designer from San Diego. I thrive in a creative environment and I am always eager to be tasked with new challenges. I possess strong communication and project planning skills and I am a highly motivated individual that works well in a team based environment. As a designer, Iâ€™ve worked closely with animal rescues, addiction treatment centers, first responders, military serviceman and veterans with marketing needs.

            A few things about me: I love the outdoors and I enjoy camping, physical training, mountain biking and shooting for sport. From time to time, I like to experience the existential pleasures of eating tacos.
